# Lots Help

## Update (2026-02-23)
- Lot workflows unchanged; latest cycle delivered portal-access linking and tenant routing dual-mode support.

## What this page does
- Manage share lots (certificates) and ownership.
- Print Original/Reprint certificate PDFs.
- Optionally email certificate notices (if enabled).

## Common actions
- Create a lot for an owner.
- Edit lot metadata/status.
- Print or email certificate for active lots.

## Tips
- `shares` and `certificateNumber` are immutable after creation.
- Email action is visible only when certificate notices are enabled and owner has email.
